# foobar2000 TripleQ v0.1
A versatile foobar2000 skin that supports 3 (switchable) display-modes as well as some
nice gadgets that help with some recurring tasks like
  - maintain a sorted collection (moving files and folders to fit a pre-defined structure)
  - keep a nice view of the well sorted collection while still being able to search the stuff in a messy unsorted folder
  - apply ratings ...also in midi-mode :-) (so you don't need to have a big player window open)
  - search your library
  - ...
  
### Mini-mode

# Installation (quick and easy)

## Portable:
1) Install [Foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/) (portable) [tested with v1.5.2]  (don't start it yet!)
2) Copy all files into the installation folder (replace existing files)
3) Start foobar2000, open preferences (Strg + p) and set your music-directory under the "Media Library" tab
4) Enjoy

## Standalone:
1) Install [Foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/) (standard) [tested with v1.5.2]  (don't start it yet!)
2) Copy all files into your foobar2000 `configuration`-folder (replace existing files)
	- it is located at `"%appdata%\foobar2000"` 
	  (if it does not yet exist, start foobar and close it again)
3) Start foobar2000, open preferences (Strg + p) and set your music-directory under the "Media Library" tab
4) Enjoy


## Important notice

The paths to the music-folder are hardcoded... so you need to change them manually!

- To make the "Utilities" buttons *"move to sorted music"* and *"move to unsorted music"* work you must
  adjust the paths in the file `FileOps-Presets.txt`
 
- To make the sorting-schemes in the folder-list tab (on the right side) work you must do the following:
 1) go to preferences (crtl + p)
 2) navigate to `Media Library > Album List Panel`
 3) double-click on each of the 'views' and change the paths in the following 2 lines:  
    (you MUST include the backslashes and don't use unnecessary spaces  
	(if your path contains spaces, you must encapsulate it in quotes)!)
	  - the base-path of your music directory:
	
			$puts(base_path,E:\Musik\)
		
	  - the name of the folder where your unsorted music is stored
		
			$puts(unsorted_path,\_Musik_Downloads\)



# General Infos
## Hotkeys
The theme incorporates the following **global hotkeys**:  
(they might interfere with other apps using similar assignments... however I've never had problems so far)

- `crtl + shift + enter`: play / pause
- `crtl + shift + up   `: previous track
- `crtl + shift + down `: next track
- `crtl + shift + left `: move 5 seconds ahead in the current track 
- `crtl + shift + right`: move 5 seconds back in the current track
- `crtl + shift + space`: activate/deactivate the player window

## Folder structure
The theme is intended to be used with a well sorted collection...  
(it comes along with file-sorting-presets that can be used to quickly adapt a nice file-structure)

In order for the theme to work properly, your music should be structured in the following form:  
(this is of course adjustable... but you would need to customize some settings)
```
- Musik
└─── _Musik_Downloads (note the underline!)
│   └─── ... (all the unsorted stuff)
│
│   Artist_1
│   └─── Albumtitle1 [Date]
│   │	│   01 - Title01.mp3
│   │	│   02 - Title02.mp3 
│   │   │   ...
│   │	│   Cover.jpg (possible names and formats specified in "Preferences/Display/Album art")
│   └─── Albumtitle2 [Date]
│   Artist_2
│   └─── ...
│    ...
│
│   _Compilations (note the underline in the beginning)
│   └─── Compilation Title [Date]
│   │	│   01 - Artist01 - Title01.mp3
│   │	│   02 - Artist02 - Title02.mp3
│   │	│   ...
│   │	│   Cover.jpg 

```
